# HR_Dataset
This was a project to dabble a bit more with some industry-specific data and generate meaningful insights while applying simple machine learning approaches. 

"The HR Dataset was designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics."

The data was obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set/data#
